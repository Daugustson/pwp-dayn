#### Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work putting together a persona and targeting an audience for your website! I felt like I knew exactly who this persona was about and how this relates to your site. The next step is that we want to make sure this translates well into a content strategy and UI design for your personal website. What kind of personal website will Jody be excited to see and use?

Your user story reads more like a continuation on her needs as a user. Instead a user story should be exactly the steps she takes to interact with your website. Doing this might help you make the connection from persona/user to the UI and content for your personal site. Use this to guide your choices later.

Overall you have very few technical errors in set up and HTML, and did a great job!

Your Milestone 1 passes at a [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.

#### Edits & Suggestions
* Try creating a user story (or stories) that follows Jody as she interacts with your website.
* Watch your indentations in your HTML. Try to keep them in line so that opening and closing tags are on the same level.
* You have the picture located in two places on GitHub - remember to clean as you go and keep things organized in your repos.
