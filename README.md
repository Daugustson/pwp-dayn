### Milestone 2a Feedback

Good work on these wireframes and content strategy - clear and concise. This will provide you with a guide for your development phase ahead.

One suggestion I for you is the portfolio section might need some re-work on the mobile layout. I would suggest being able to view the images one-by-one as you scroll. If you need more clarification, I can show you an example of what I mean. For the desktop view I think you you could also consider interactive gallery functionality like [FancyBox3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/).

Here are a few links to a few other things you might want as part of your upcoming development phase.

Extra Resources:
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for custom typography - it has ~1000 fonts and is easy to integrate.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a good quality free library for including iconography.


Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin development on your PWP. Keep going!
