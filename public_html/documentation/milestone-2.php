			<h2>Welcome</h2>
			<p>This is where I will introduce myself along with my professional tittle.  This will all be laid on back drop of the Sandia mountain at sunset. </p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>In this section I will show my newly found professional aptitudes. Listing the skill sets I have acquired during my time at Deep Dive Bootcamp.  I hope to convey my willingness to go the extra mile and be a team player in this segment. Will add a picture of me to give a little personal touch. </p>

			<h2>Testimonials</h2>
			<p>My testimonial spot is where I hope to get my capstone project team mates a chance to give a little insight to what it was like to work with me. Looking at doing a simple click slider to toggle through the testimonials.</p>

			<h2>Portfolio</h2>
			<p>I will highlight my capstone project here. This section will grow over time as I complete more projects. </p>

			<h2>Contact</h2>
